        This app allows users to easily generate Secret Santa pairings!
        My friends and I have done a gift exchange each year during the holidays,
        so I thought of creating this for us to use in future gift exchanges and
        to build an application from the ground up.

        I created this app using React, NodeJS, and MongoDB.
